### What is a linked list 

A linked list is a datastructure in which elements are not stored in conteguous memory locations. Instead, each element is stored in a node, which has a pointer to the next node.

> Contegious memory means that consecutive blocks of memory are allocated to the user.

They are used over arrays because they grow and reduce in size dynamically.



### Types of linkedlists

1. A singly linked list is the simplest type of linked list in which each node contains some information/data and only one pointer which points to the next node in the linked list. 

2. Circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the last node points to the first node.

3. Doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains some information/data and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node.
